Automate with Cron
Automate the entire process using cron:

Open the crontab editor:

bash

crontab -e

Add the following lines to run the scripts periodically (e.g., every hour):

bash

0 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/proxyscrape.py

5 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/proxytransfer.py

Security Considerations
SSH Keys: Use SSH keys instead of passwords for secure file transfer.

This setup ensures that you can scrape SOCKS5 proxies from multiple URLs listed in sources.list, check their status, and securely transfer the list of live proxies to another machine. By scheduling these tasks with cron, the process will be automated and run periodically.
